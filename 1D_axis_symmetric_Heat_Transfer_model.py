# The mathematical model of Heat Transfer is represented in the chapter
# Heat Transfer during Quenching Processes (Solving method for heat conduction equation)
#
# The Heat Transfer model of a cylindrical solid object is considered
# Due to the symmetry of the object , the temopro-spatial distribution of temperature
# at the half of the cross section of the cylinder is calculated. Therefore, we are using a 1D axis-symmetrical model
#
# The transient heat transfer during quenching can mathematically be described by an appropriate
# form of a Fourierâ€™s heat conduction equation (Eq.2). For the 1D axis-symmetrical model, the (Eq.8)
# was taken into account. The solution of (Eq.8) is obtained by the Finite Difference Method (FDM).
#
# The variables and constants ar the followings:
#  nn               The number of the local coordinate nodes
#  radius           The radius of the cylindrical object (s)
#  htc              The value of Heat Transfer Coefficient (Wm-2k-1)
#  t_start          The starting temperature (C))
#  t_quenchant      The temperature of the quenchant (C)
#  time_            The time elapsed (s)
#  dt               The time step (s)
